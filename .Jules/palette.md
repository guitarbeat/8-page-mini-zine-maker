## 2024-05-24 - Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability
**Learning:** Users often miss keyboard shortcuts. Adding them to tooltips (`title` attribute) and `aria-keyshortcuts` makes them discoverable and accessible without cluttering the UI.
**Action:** When adding keyboard shortcuts, always mirror them in the element's `title` (e.g., "Save (Ctrl+S)") and `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute.
