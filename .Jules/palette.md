## 2025-01-28 - [Visible Focus States]
**Learning:** `outline: none` removes the browser's default focus ring, making keyboard navigation difficult or impossible for sighted users. While custom hover states were present, the lack of an equivalent `:focus-visible` state left a critical accessibility gap.
**Action:** When removing default outlines, always immediately pair `outline: none` with a `:focus-visible` rule that re-introduces a clear, high-contrast indicator (e.g., `outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent)`). Grouping `:hover` and `:focus-visible` styles can be efficient but ensure the visual treatment is appropriate for both contexts. Also, adding `aria-valuetext` to range inputs provides a more human-readable value for screen reader users.
